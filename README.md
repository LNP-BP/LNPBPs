# LNPBPs: LNP/BP Standards Repository

LNP/BP stands for "Bitcoin Protocol / Lightning Network Protocol". This 
repository covers standards & best practices for Layer 2+ in cases when they do
not require soft- or hard-forks of the Bitcoin blockchain level and are not 
directly related to issues covered in Lightning Network RFCs (BOLTs).

Basically, LNP/BPs cover everything that can be anchored to Bitcoin 
transactions, defines primitives for L2+ solution design and describes complex 
use cases which can be built from some primitives. This allows such solutions as
financial assets, storage, messaging, computing and different forms of secondary
markets leveraging Bitcoin security model and Bitcoin as a method of 
payment/medium of exchange.

Criteria for a LNP/BP specification proposal:

* Should not be covered by existing or proposed BIPs
* Should not cause soft- or hard-fork in Bitcoin blockchain (but may depend on 
  soft-forks from an existing BIP proposals)
* Should not distort Bitcoin miner's economic incentives
* Should not pollute Bitcoin blockchain with unnecessary non-transaction related
  data or have to maintain such pollution as low as possible
* Must not require a utility or security tokens to function (but may enable
  creation of digital assets or tokenized physical goods)
* Must not depend on non-bitcoin blockchains (but may be applicable to other 
  blockchains)
